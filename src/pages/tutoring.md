With a Bachelor of Mathematics Honours degree from the University of Waterloo, 3+ years of combined internship experience, a job (with a baked-in promotion!) straight out of university and a 95% grade 12 average (math: 95%, computer science: 98%) from India, which is considered harder and more competitive than North American curriculums, I strongly believe I am qualified to help you on your journey to ace your high school exams and fulfill your early career/internship goals.
