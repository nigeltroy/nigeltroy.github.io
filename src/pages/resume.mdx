## Work Experience

### [Replicant](https://www.replicant.com/)

  #### Software Engineer II
  Sep 2023 - Present ({monthsAtCurrentJob} month{monthSuffix})

  - Led several epics as part of the implementation of a new architectural shift in the company's product.
    - Involved requirement collection, RFC and spiking, ticket creation, task delegation, ticket implementation and hyper-care.
  - Led several projects aimed at adding or modifying features in an existing internal SDK used by bot developers to build customer bots.
    - Implemented several "components" utilizing highly constrained LLMs under the hood to reduce bot developer code and time and create more natural conversations while prioritizing safety.
    - Highlight: Location Component - used to collect a person's location:
      - Ensured conversational excellence to keep the caller happy.
      - Fine-tuned LLM prompts to more accurately extract locations from a caller's utterances.
      - Worked with the Google Maps API for location validation.
      - Created detailed documentation for bot developers to utilize the component and create meaningful scripts to speak to callers.
      - Worked directly with bot developers during and after implementation to tweak the component as we got more user data in.
      - Observed an uplift of more than 20% from previous location collection methods.
  - Collaborated with other teams (front-end, SRE, platform) to ensure that internal API contracts were created and maintained so that all teams could develop their product in parallel with minimal disruption.
    - Worked heavily with the front-end team to ensure that the back-end of the Low Code bot UI they were creating worked as they expected and contracts between the two teams were maintained.
    - Consulted often on SRE and DevEx issues like monorepo development and Gitlab pipeline improvements.
  - Took initiative to implement smaller features aimed at increasing developer velocity without explicit ticketing while balancing ticketed work, some of which were converted into full-blown features/tools widely used within the company.
    - Some examples: Sentry monitoring plugins, custom ESLint linting rules, monorepo developer tools with Nx and pnpm, VS Code extension for bot developers to easily visualize bots right within their code editor.
  - Mentored teammates - helped them grow in their careers, gave constructive feedback for growth, empowered them to grow by giving them opportunities to contribute where possible.
  - Part of a cross-team engineering division aimed at identifying and eliminating engineering blockers for feature implementation and, ultimately, product adoption and growth. I am the only non-Senior member of this team, all others being Staff Engineer to Director level.
  - Wrote documentation on both exploratory fields (RFCs, spikes on features), general software fields (unit testing philosophy) and user-facing documentation (how to use aforementioned components, how to use customer dashboards, repo contributing docs).
  - Didn't hesitate to question decisions made by higher-ups and seniors.
    - Example: While seniors and managers were confident a certain database migration and code update would go smoothly, I called out a gap they missed even though everyone else was convinced the changes were ready to be deployed, potentially saving the product from encountering issues post-migration and triggering a more strict and detailed process around migrations which has stuck around to this day.
  - Heavily participated in on-call and triage duties.
  - Interviewed candidates for Junior and Intermediate roles.

  #### Software Developer Intern
  May 2022 - Aug 2023 (16 months)

  - Created new and contributed to existing pages on the Replicant Dashboard, allowing for more self-service capabilities for customers.
  - Implemented features for Replicant's in-house SDK used for creating bots.
  - Created and maintained a new visualization tool for building bots within VS Code using React, MUI and VS Code API.
  - Actively gathered feedback from stakeholders and UX designers, and iterated on designs and features.
  - Worked on several side projects that transitioned to becoming full-fledged features and applications due to positive user feedback.

### [Geotab](https://www.geotab.com/)
    
  #### Software Developer Intern
  Sep 2021 - Apr 2022 (8 months)

  - Implemented the Asset Monitoring page in Geotab's customer web portal, MyGeotab, used to track customer cargo on an interactive map.
    - Used Typescript and an in-house Geotab framework to create a responsive and accessible UI to display data of customer payloads and cargo.
    - Facilitated final step of migration of over 25,000 telematics devices from Lat-Lon and Intendia customers to Geotab.
  - Actively participated in product development and UI/UX meetings with different Geotab teams, managers and stakeholders as one of the first Lat-Lon post-migration team members.

  #### Software Developer Intern
  Jan 2021 - Apr 2021 (4 months)

  - Developed pipeline in .NET Framework, Python and SQL Server to migrate historic user data from Lat-Lon to Geotab and initialize mappings to facilitate future live data flow.
  - Owned codebase of an internal tool used to configure hardware units and send out orders to manufacturing.
  - Implemented new features and looked over deployment of changes to dev, test and production servers.
  - Created internal tools in .NET Framework and SQL Server for assigning sensors to hardware telematics devices and mailing customer orders to production.
  - Optimized and refactored legacy code dealing with hardware-level EEPROM configuration changes for telematics devices.

### [HyAlto](https://www.hyalto.com/)

  #### Developer Intern
  Apr 2020 - Aug 2020 (4 months)

  - Optimized event processing and API pipelines by replacing existing software infrastructure with new workflow based on AWS Lambda, AWS API Gateway and Serverless that updated the central MySQL database and published AWS SNS topics.
  - Developed event-driven sync project that tracks VM infrastructure changes and sends API requests via an asynchronous task queue using VMware API, Python and AMQP.
  - Modified response payloads from Laravel endpoints to comply with newer HyAlto API requirements.
  - Contributed to company investment pitches by writing MySQL and MongoDB database analysis tools to get metrics in Python.

  #### Full Stack Web Developer Intern
  Sep 2019 - Dec 2019 (4 months)

  - Developed backend for a new historical VM usage feature in the HyAlto portal.
    - Wrote Python scripts to get, process and store data via VMWare API calls, and deploy them using AWS Lambda.
    - Cached data in Redis to immediately sync with the portal and stored it in MySQL and Postgres for older timeframes.
  - Set up Laravel and CodeIgniter endpoints using MVC architecture and auth middleware, and tested them using Postman.
  - Replaced existing endpoints and data processing infrastructure, and sped up the sync process significantly.

### [Delhi Pollution Control Committee](https://www.dpcc.delhigovt.nic.in/#gsc.tab=0)

  Jul 2018 - Aug 2018 (2 months)

  - Analyzed datasets of various meteorological parameters, missing sensor data and frequency of dangerous days.
  - Wrote a report on conclusions drawn from the data, which was used by the government to improve sensor conditions.
  - Built an app in Python and Leaflet that facilitated easy viewing of pollution and meteorological data on a choropleth map.
