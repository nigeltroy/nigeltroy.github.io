    Hi! I'm Nigel, a Software Engineer II at [Replicant](https://www.replicant.ai).

    I graduated from the University of Waterloo in 2023 with a BMath Honors degree, majoring in
    Computational Mathematics and minoring in Combinatorics and Optimization.

    My hobbies include playing video games like League of Legends and Teamfight Tactics and working out at the gym.

    We offer high school and early level university mathematics and computer science tutoring as well as internship and early career coaching. See the <a href="/tutoring">Tutoring</a> page for more info.
